The roots are plentiful, if not varied; and, thanks to that Hikmalat outcropping I passed yesterday, they are particularly nourishing. I guess all those hours poring over dusty books, learning which plants are safe to eat and where they grow, actually proved useful. Thank the Gift: I won't starve.\n\nCould do with some more flavor, though. I'll say that, though all my old scholarly friends will mock me mercilessly when they read this.\n\nIf they read this.\n\nIt was your idea, they'll say. You could be snug at the temple, enjoying three square meals with an abundance of color and flavor, and sleep tonight in a soft bed knowing that you have spent that day in the noble pursuit of learning. But no, and here's where they'll wave whatever book they're holding in my face, dust rippling from its pages and shimmering in stray shafts of sunlight, you had to see if the rumors were true. Wisdom and knowledge weren't enough for your ambition. You had to go seek another kind of temple. And you didn’t even pack enough food!\n\nThey’ll be right, of course, when they give me this speech—when I see them again.\n\nIf I see anyone again.\n\nBut I’m right too—by almighty Hikma, I swear I’m right. Those pilgrims who passed through last season couldn’t have been lying. They said they’d seen it: a temple just like ours, but devoted to story—to song—to beauty. Far away, of course . . . across the mountains, at the edge of the desert . . . but there. It exists.\n\nAnd I belong there. I’ve always known the scholarly life wasn’t for me. I couldn’t even keep a proper account of my days without weaving in tales—snatches of song—the odd sketch. Even in the driest, dustiest academic tome, I saw echoes of color . . . felt the frigid breath of ancient snowstorms . . . heard ghosts of tunes sung over old, forgotten campfires. I knew THAT knowledge was my vocation—my destiny—my true home.\n\nLook at me now: still keeping this Hikma-blasted journal, according to scholarly training, but waxing eloquent about dreams and destiny and old campfires. I don’t belong back there. I belong . . . ahead. Somewhere.\n\nWish I had one of those campfires here now, though. Or at least that I’d had the chance to practice building a fire, instead of just reading about it.\n\nI bet these roots would taste better cooked."

    "tag": "Ancient Journal",
    "content": "Not the music itself, of course; he didn’t open my head and pluck it out, or snip it from my soul. It’s still in there, somewhere. I could still sing it now—play it, too, if the\n\nroom would just stop spinning for one gifted moment. But the scroll, with the words and notes—the one I jotted down for my own personal use, and only showed to him once he was\n\ncrying so hard my head hurt . . . or maybe he was laughing. Was I laughing? That sounds right; we were singing, and laughing, and crying, and then . . . I woke up, and the scroll\n\nwas gone.\n\nSo he stole it . . . didn’t he?\n\nIt’s all muddy and swirling in my memory—but that’s why I’m here. Melly always says: “Write it down, sort it out!” So, I’m writing . . . though the light is so bright on the paper,\n\nand the letters are all jumping around like they’re a jig come to life, and the words are bouncing around to the same tune in my head . . .\n\nA tune. That’s what started it.\n\nHe heard me before I saw him—said he did, anyway. Heard me whistling my new song as I was walking home, and caught up to me right outside the pub. “Just passin’ through,” he said,\n\n“collectin’ tales and tunes as I go. Shall we trade a few, and share some drinks into the bargain?”\n\nHe didn’t look evil—a tad unusual, but that’s to be expected with strangers. Tiny fella, but with a smile and a spirit big as a house. We don’t get too many newcomers, and precious\n\nlittle of new tales or tunes. A drink and a few stories sounded mighty fine, and I said as much, so into the pub we went.\n\nIt’s coming clear now—sorting itself out, just like Melly said it would. He didn’t ask for my tune straight out; he laid the trap all sweet and sunny, singing and playing songs and\n\nstories from places I’ve never heard of. But I saw them all last night—saw them, heard them, and felt myself there. That’s the main picture I can’t get out of my mind: that little\n\nfella, perched on the bench, wailing away on that lute like it was part of him, weaving us all into his spell.\n\nThen he asked me to share my tune, and it seemed only fitting to invite him back here, where I could play and sing in the comfort of home. No idea what time it was, though Melly\n\nseemed pretty put-out when we showed up at the door—I’ll get an earful about that today, for sure. I played my song, and he was surely the best listener I’ve ever had; he asked for\n\nit again, and played along this time, and then we played and sang it together, over and over. I felt right close to this little fella; he seemed to understand the song even better\n\nthan I did.\n\nNext thing I knew, I was showing him my song-scrolls. I even showed him my great-great-great grandpa’s journals: records of one of the first Song Sanctuaries ever built, back when\n\nthe Gift was mostly just used for learning.\n\nMighty precious, those journals—but he didn’t take them. He just took the song. I’m starting to remember . . . he did ask for it. Said he was collecting songs from all over, and\n\nkeeping a record for future generations, long after we’re all dead and gone . . . some high-minded mission or other. I said no, of course . . . or was it maybe? Or did I just fall\n\nasleep?\n\nNo matter: that silver-tongued traveler stole my song, and he’s gonna give it to all them future generations.\n\nMelly’s gonna have my hide."

The Great Star fell, far to the north, and those who live by the stars must go to seek it.\n\n“It has begun,” the old ones said. Surely the Great Star is but the first to arrive—more will come, and when they do, we must be ready. For they are coming to take the faithful\n\nback to the skies: those who have always followed the stars will ascend to the heavens, and live among their divine kin forever.\n\nSo we must go to meet the Great Star. We must learn what preparations are required, and take the tidings—and the charted course—back to our people. But how can we find the way when\n\nour ancient heavenly map has veiled itself in clouds and storms?\n\nIt is not like me to be afraid. I am an experienced sea voyager; that is why they chose me. Me, and my young son—not young any more, practically a man—for we have ventured farther\n\nthrough these waters than any dare to go, and we always return. Even after the seas claimed my husband, we kept sailing.\n\n“How can you bear it?” my people asked, at the start of each new voyage. “How can you trust yourself to the sea when it has taken so much from you?” I could not speak, but my son\n\nsmiled—his father’s smile—and gave his father’s old reply: “The sea is treacherous; but the stars are ever faithful, and they will always lead us home.”\n\nI know the stars will lead us. We are out farther now than ever before, but though the shape of the stars may change, their song remains constant. I hear my husband’s spirit—hear\n\nhis whispers, even amidst the crashing of the waves and the howling of the storm. I hear his heart in my son’s voice as he comforts me.\n\nWe always knew our boy is special: he not only sees the stars, but hears them, and speaks to them. “I hear them still, Mother,” he says, with that smile bright enough to light our\n\nway through the dark. “They are speaking; they are singing; they will guide us to the Great Star that has fallen. Such a gift could not be given in vain.”\n\nI believe him. I know the stars will lead us. So great a gift would not simply abandon us to vanish beneath the waves.\n\nI know the stars hear him. I know they see me.\n\nI only wish I could see them tonight."

If anyone asks, I can simply tell them I am doing my job and\n\nanalyzing data, like a good scholar. No one has to know that what I’m analyzing is just how impossible that job is.\n\nData! Too much . . . so much data. Every day, new uses for the tool are discovered—blueprints for new machines are drawn up—new experiments are devised and put on the list to be\n\nimplemented. Even with the improved communication among our various facilities, it is madness to think we could ever record all of our findings accurately and comprehensibly. Our\n\nbrains simply aren’t designed for it (to say nothing of our hands; mine cramp every night from hours and hours of frantic scribbling).\n\nOh, how I wish I lived all those generations ago, when the tool first appeared. If our records—not to mention my own family history—are to be believed, the people saw it as a gift\n\nfrom the gods: to be worshiped and revered, not used or analyzed. My scholarly habits compel me to provide two logical reasons for such a backward-thinking wish: first, composing\n\nhymns in praise of the tool sounds much simpler and more relaxing than cataloging its multitudinous plethora of uses; second, I’d like to give those gods a piece of my mind for\n\nsending such a gift without better instructions.\n\nBut I don’t dare voice these desires anywhere but this journal. Ever since great-great-great uncle . . . . Marcus? Possibly? Never could get a definitive confirmation from\n\nGrandfather about that being his name—ran off to help found the first artistic facility, our family has been under constant scrutiny for being untrustworthy, or—GASP!—unscholarly.\n\nNever mind that he succeeded, and those facilities are now flourishing all over the world, in exquisite harmony with our centers of learning; no, all the people around here can\n\nfocus on is his unmitigated gall. Who in their right mind would prefer sketching and singing to STUDYING?\n\nSometimes, I feel a deep kinship with great-great-great uncle Possibly-Marcus.\n\nIf only this work could feel more like a song—or better yet, a conversation. If only the gods had sent not only the gift, but other beings along with it—some form of life clever\n\nenough to record all of this information, yet not so clever that they’d misuse the tool or wander off to use it for their own ends . . .\n\nIf only the wisdom we’ve gained from the tool could inspire us to invent such beings ourselves . . .\n\nIf only . . .\n\nI must away, journal of mine. I feel the spirit of great-great-great uncle Possibly-Marcus moving within me—but this time, I think the results may prove more academically useful\n\nthan any of my ancestors (or colleagues, hopefully) could dream"

It is a great way to spot good deals and track down what you need.\n\nIf you keep a sharp eye, you might even find a chance to buy low in one place and sell high in another."
